Hi! I am an incoming Ph.D. student at the [University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu), advised by [Heng Huang](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~heng/). Currently, I work as a software engineer at the [University of Maryland Institute for Health Computing (UM-IHC)](https://www.ihc.umd.edu/). Previously, I was a full-time researcher at the University of Maryland Medical Intelligent Imaging (UM2ii) Center, where I was advised by [Vishwa Parekh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZCJQ-ZMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Paul Yi](https://www.stjude.org/directory/y/paul-yi.html). Prior to that, I received dual B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Maryland in 2022.

My research is primarly focused on the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and medical imaging, with the goal of improving healthcare outcomes. My current research interests include:

1. **Multi-modal models** that integrate imaging, clinical, and multi-omics data to enable opportunistic screening for early-stage disease detection.

2. **Federated learning** techniques that leverage distributed, heterogeneous data to reduce burden of medical image annotation in a privacy-preserving way.

3. **Trustworthy and explainable AI** to adapt to distribution shifts over time and mitigate algorithmic bias.

Furthermore, I have ongoing collaborations with clinicians in translational research to bring cutting-edge AI research from bench to bedside. In my free time, I enjoy reading about history, collecting vintage maps, gardening, and hiking.
