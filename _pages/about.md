Hi! I am an incoming Ph.D. student at the [University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu), advised by [Heng Huang](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~heng/). Currently, I work as a software engineer at the [University of Maryland Institute for Health Computing (UM-IHC)](https://www.ihc.umd.edu/). My research is primarly focused on the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and medical imaging, with the goal of improving healthcare outcomes. 

I am currently interested in **multi-modal foundation models** that integrate imaging, clinical, and multi-omics data to enable opportunistic screening for early-stage, low-cost disease detection, **federated learning** techniques that leverage distributed, heterogeneous data to reduce burden of medical image annotation in a privacy-preserving way, and **trustworthy and explainable AI** to adapt to distribution shifts over time and mitigate algorithmic bias.
