Pranav Kulkarni is a Bioinformatics Software Engineer I at the University of Maryland Institute for Health Computing. He received his B.S. in Computer Science and B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Maryland, College Park. His research focuses on the overarching goal of bringing AI from bench to bedside, by pioneering advances in federated lifelong learning frameworks to facilitate collaboration between distributed research groups, optimization of AI-assisted clinical decision-making by reducing burden of data curation, data annotation, and training/inference, and the implication of adversarial attacks on fairness and bias in medical imaging AI and how they might propagate. In the near future, Pranav aspires to attend graduate school to carve his path as a future computer scientist.
