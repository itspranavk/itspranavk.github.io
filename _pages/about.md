<span class="font-weight-bold">Pranav Kulkarni</span> is a Bioinformatics Software Engineer I at the University of Maryland Institute for Health Computing (UM-IHC). He received his dual Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Maryland. 

His research focuses on the overarching goal of bringing AI from bench to bedside, spanning federated continual learning frameworks, resource-efficient AI systems, and AI security, bias, and fairness in the clinical environment. His work has been recognized through spotlight talks at international conferences, such as Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL), and patent pending technology on cloud-based medical image streaming for high-throughput AI inference.

In the near future, Pranav aspires to attend graduate school to carve his path as a future computer scientist. When Pranav is not talking in third person, he enjoys gardening, photography, and hiking.
