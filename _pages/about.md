Hi! I am a first-year CS PhD student at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu), advised by [Heng Huang](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~heng/). I am also a Graduate Research Assistant at the [University of Maryland Institute for Health Computing (UM-IHC)](https://www.ihc.umd.edu/), where I work on multi-modal foundation models for cardiovascular and lung diseases.

My research is primarily focused on the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and medical imaging, with the goal of enabling opportunistic screening and early-stage disease detection in everyday clinical practice. I am currently interested in 1️⃣ **Multi-modal foundation models** that integrate imaging with clinical and multi-omics data for clinical decision-making; 2️⃣ **Federated learning** methods to develop cross-institutional models using distributed, heterogeneous data while preserving patient privacy; and 3️⃣ **Trustworthy and explainable AI** systems that adapt to distribution shifts over time, align with nuanced human feedback, and mitigate algorithmic bias. 
 
In my free time, I enjoy hiking, gardening, and reading about history, biogeography, and urban planning!
