Hi! I am an incoming CS Ph.D. student at the [University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu), advised by [Heng Huang](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~heng/). Currently, I am a bioinformatics software engineer at the [University of Maryland Institute for Health Computing (UM-IHC)](https://www.ihc.umd.edu/), where I build [user-friendly tools](https://www.podvis.org/) for visualizing and analyzing biomedical data.

My research is primarily focused on the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and medical imaging, with the goal of enabling opportunistic screening for early-stage, low-cost disease detection. I am currently interested in 1️⃣ **Multi-modal foundation models** that integrate imaging, clinical, and multi-omics data; 2️⃣ **Federated learning** methods to leverage distributed, heterogeneous data while preserving privacy; and 3️⃣ **Trustworthy and explainable AI** systems that adapt to distribution shifts over time.
 
In my free time, I enjoy hiking, gardening, and reading about history, biogeography, and urban planning!
