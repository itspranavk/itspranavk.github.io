Hi! I am an incoming Ph.D. student at the [University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu), advised by [Heng Huang](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~heng/). Currently, I am a software engineer with joint appointments at the [University of Maryland Institute for Health Computing (UM-IHC)](https://www.ihc.umd.edu/) and [University of Maryland School of Medicine](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/). Previously, I was a full-time researcher at the University of Maryland Medical Intelligent Imaging (UM2ii) Center, advised by [Vishwa Parekh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZCJQ-ZMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Paul Yi](https://www.stjude.org/directory/y/paul-yi.html).

My research is primarly focused at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and medical imaging, with the goal of improving healthcare outcomes. My current research interests include:

1. **Multi-modal models** that integrate imaging and clinical data to enable opportunistic screening for early-stage disease detection.

2. **Federated learning** techniques that leverage distributed, heterogeneous data to reduce burden of medical image annotation in a privacy-preserving way.

3. **Trustworthy and explainable AI** to adapt to distribution shifts over time and mitigate algorithmic bias.

My work has been published in top international conferences and journals (e.g., MIDL, _Radiology_). Furthermore, I have ongoing collaborations with clinicians in translational research to bring cutting-edge AI research from bench to bedside. In my free time, I enjoy reading about history, collecting vintage maps, gardening, and hiking.
